      <h2>Back in action!</h2>

      <p>
        After one lazy year without plant contact I am back in the
        trade market again. I love this branch and can not live
        without it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time I am not alone — I am very pleased to have my son
        Thomas joining me. Thomas is a reliable, positive
        and structured person so he will be well prepared for this
        tricky business. I will teach him all I know before
        age catches up with me. I have worked with Thomas before
        and seen that he already has a solid plant nursery
        education. Together we have more than 60 years of
        experience in the plant and flower trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entire Alberti family has a long legacy in most
        areas of the flower and plant industry — from import and
        export to running our own nursery and garden center
        and several plant and flower shops in Stockholm. We had the
        famous Jungleboat, "Djungelbåten", a 40 meter greenhouse
        barge right in the middle of Stockholm City.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last 35 years I also founded and ran Asian Cuttings
        in Sri Lanka and Siam Plant in Bangkok.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, Thomas and I have decided to gather all our eggs
        in one basket. We will represent one of the oldest, most
        experienced farms in Sri Lanka — the Ramya Horticulture.
        This top notch farm produces rooted and unrooted
        cuttings as well as an assortment of different potplants
        and they even run their own laboratory.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Thailand we have a partnership with a fellow family
        business — TOC Thai orchids, the largest cut orchid and
        plant exporter.
      </p>

      <p>
        We look forward to supplying all kinds of tropical plants
        from seeds to full size trees and palms to customers
        all over the world — old and new friends!
